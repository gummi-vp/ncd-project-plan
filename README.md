# Draco Card Game

Players can try to win the game by making the right move in this card game where some chance is also effective.

# How do I use the features of NEAR Protocol?

I can use PersistentVector to keep numbers of cards. Using Context and PersistentMap, I save the player's (sender) name and the highest winning streak to the storage. I can determine the winner (or draw) of the game with if else statements. With the Assert function, I ensure that the same function is not called repeatedly.
